# Guidelines

- ⚠️ Do not directly push to [main branch](https://github.com/warmachine028/HR-Chatbot/tree/main), make a PR and wait for atleast 1 approval.
- ⚠️ Pull the latest code from [main branch](https://github.com/warmachine028/HR-Chatbot/tree/main) before creating PRs to avoid merge conflicts.
- ⚠️ Do not modify code under [`.github`](./.github/) directory, as it contains *workflows* and *automation* scripts for maintaining the project.
- Everyone must create their separate branch in the following format: `<your name>-main` and push code to their specific branches only.
- Please maintain commit message format for better debugging and maintenance of code. See [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
- Maintain directory structure and write all sripts inside [src/](./src/) directory.
